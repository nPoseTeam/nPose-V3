    - If you distribute the nPose scripts, you must leave them full perms.
    - If you modify the nPose scripts and distribute the modifications, 
      you must also make your modifications full perms.

"Full perms" means having the modify, copy, and transfer permissions enabled in Second Life and/or other virtual world platforms derived from Second Life (such as OpenSim).  If the platform should allow more fine-grained permissions, then "full perms" will mean the most permissive possible set of permissions allowed by the platform.
