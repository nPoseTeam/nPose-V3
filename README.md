nPose is an LSL script for use in Second Life® that allows one or more avatars to sit on (and otherwise control) objects and rez props, without poseballs. A versatile animation system/engine. The code is OpenSource and all management is by volunteers.

If you want to download the scripts, please use this link: https://github.com/nPoseTeam/nPose-V3/releases/latest  
The master branch may or may not contain the latest released version.

The nPose scripts are licensed under the GPLv2 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt), with the following addendum:  
The nPose scripts are free to be copied, modified, and redistributed, subject to the following conditions:

    - If you distribute the nPose scripts, you must leave them full perms.
    - If you modify the nPose scripts and distribute the modifications, 
      you must also make your modifications full perms.

"Full perms" means having the modify, copy, and transfer permissions enabled in Second Life and/or other virtual world platforms derived from Second Life (such as OpenSim).  If the platform should allow more fine-grained permissions, then "full perms" will mean the most permissive possible set of permissions allowed by the platform.
